      <guid>https://improv.com/raleigh/comic/rickey+smiley/</guid>
      <description>Dec 4-6 - With a career spanning over more than 30 years, legendary comedian, actor, author, TV personality and award-winning radio host Rickey Smiley is just getting started. The two-time Marconi award winner and host of the Rickey Smiley Morning Show anchors the #1 syndicated urban radio program in the country reaching over seven million weekly listeners in 75+ markets. As a stand up comedian, the veteran who got his start on Def Comedy Jam and as a host of BET’s Comic View continues to light up stages across the nation, hitting comedy clubs and theaters on his stand alone tour, as well as all-star lineups like the Martin Lawrence headlined LIT AF TOUR, as well as Martin's upcoming Y’ALL KNOW WHAT IT IS TOUR. His comedy specials COMEDY CENTRAL PRESENTS: RICKEY SMILEY and RICKEY SMILEY: OPEN CASKET SHARP have delighted fans for decades with clipable moments and evergreen jokes establishing Rickey as a true comedy force. His latest special, directed by filmmaker David Talbert and shot in Rickey’s hometown of Birmingham, AL comes to us over a decade later and is due to debut late 2024/early 2025. Additionally, his live show Rickey Smiley Karaoke Night is a monthly treat that regularly sells out within days of going on sale. Though Rickey is mostly known for his joke writing, he is also the author of two books: STAND BY YOUR TRUTH: AND THEN RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! which came out in 2017 as an ode to fatherhood and the principles that he was raised on which helped guide him in his life and career to become the success he is today. He is now passing on those principles to his own children and hundreds of young men and women in need of advice on how to better their own lives. The memoir acts as a painful prequel to the soon-to-be-published SIDESHOW: LIVING WITH LOSS AND MOVING FORWARD WITH FAITH in which Rickey recounts his journey from the painful experience of losing his eldest son to drug addiction in 2023 (September 17/Harper Collins). SIDESHOW delves deep into Rickey’s relationship with his son and showcases how through faith, love and understanding the healing process can begin. While the biography reveals stories from a very personal perspective, there are relatable themes for anyone who has loved someone who struggles with substance abuse, drug addiction, or losing a child before their time. The Birmingham native continues to build on a passionate fanbase amassing over 18+ million followers across all social media platforms. Generations of fans stretching across his career from the multiple movie appearances in movie favorites like FRIDAY AFTER NEXT and BAGGAGE CLAIM to his multiple TV series THE RICKEY SMILEY SHOW and RICKEY SMILEY FOR REAL, continue to find Rickey’s wholesome family comedy a welcome reprieve to the stresses of daily life. His iconic characters including “Mrs. Bernice Jenkins,” “Lil’ Daryl,” “Joe Willie,” and “Beauford” as well as his classic Prank Calls live on in comedy lore as cult favorites laying the foundation for the legacy that Rickey continues to grow today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.ticketweb.com/i/00/08/21/74/51/Original.jpg?v=7?v=7" alt="Rickey Smiley"/&gt;</description>

      <title>Lil Duval</title>
      <link>https://improv.com/raleigh/comic/lil+duval/</link>
      <guid>https://improv.com/raleigh/comic/lil+duval/</guid>
      <description>Nov 21-23 - Celebrities aren’t exactly pouring out of Jacksonville Florida but that’s only made Roland Powell’s grind more ferocious. Proclaiming himself “Lil Duval” after the county from which he hails he has literally put his home turf on his back as he touches every nook and cranny available with his special brand of humor. Some comedians work at making people laugh. Others just do. Born with the gift to make people laugh Lil Duval explains that for him “comedy was a natural thing. People always found me funny. It wasn’t that I was trying to be funny; they just found me funny.” Participating in pep rallies in high school and other activities where all eyes were on him really kicked Lil Duval into high gear. The limelight just suited him and he wanted more. “I heard them screaming for me and I was like ‘oh yeah this is what I need to be doing ’” he smiles. “I knew I would be in entertainment because I felt like an entertainer.” Ultimately he envisioned himself on the big screen and particularly admired the work of Chris Tucker. That’s how he got into comedy actually. “I saw Chris Tucker on Friday and I was like ‘that’s what I want to do.’ Then I saw him on Def Comedy Jam so I was like ‘oh that’s the way you do it. You become a stand?up comedian and you’ll be in the movies.’ That’s how it started to build.” Not one to waste time Lil Duval went right at it taking to the stage of Atlanta’s legendary Uptown Comedy Corner. Pretty soon he was a regular there as well as any other spots with a microphone and people ready to laugh. A hilarious 2001 performance at a contest in Oakland caught the attention of Cedric the Entertainer’s camp and Lil Duval was invited to hit the road with Cedric and four other comedians. That successful run on the road led to a featured spot on Cedric the Entertainer: Starting Lineup first televised and then released on DVD. During the tour Lil Duval developed his signature routine “Stalker’s Anthem (Bitch U Mine).” Set to Musiq Soulchild’s 2000 hit “Just Friends ” Lil Duval twists the original song which preaches about taking it slow and making the girl comfortable into a pressure?filled encounter at a club: “Girl I know this might sound strange/But let me know if I’m outta order steppin to you this way/See I been buying you drinks for a while/And I’ll let you know . . . . Bitch U Mine!” A forever hustler Lil Duval stayed on the road slanging his brand of humor. Along the way he also released two underground comedy DVDs: Dat Boy Funny (2003) and Put Your Hands on Me (2005). Additionally he appeared in Three 6 Mafia’s Choices II: The Setup as well as hot videos like T.I.’s “Rubberband Man ” “24s ” “Whatever You Like” and Yung Joc’s “It’s Goin Down” and “Coffee Shop.” Most recently he’s added Twitter to his campaign and regularly dispenses his thoughts via @lilduval as raw and witty as only he can. So much so that he now has over 600 000 followers. It’s Lil Duval’s abilityto ride the current and know what people want that keeps him winning. “I was always on the internet. It’s just like in the streets ” he explains. “When new dope comes out if you want to stay popping in the streets you go with the new dope. When people were still on MySpace I was popular on MySpace. I had like a 100 000 friends. The new thing is Twitter.” Embracing the new is indeed a part of Lil Duval’s makeup but he prides himself most on staying true to himself. “I stay in my own lane. I don’t do what anybody else is doing. I try to do what I’m doing. I like to be the one that’s being followed instead of following someone else. There’s no blueprint to this shit so I mean when you follow somebody else’s blueprint just because it worked for them doesn’t mean it’ll work for you.” That sense of originality is one of the reasons Lil Duval attracted the attention of hip-hop’s reigning king early on. A fan since 2001 when Duval first started wrecking stages T.I. didn’t hesitate later on to add Lil Duval to his label Grand Hustle’s comedy roster. "He's someone who says what everyone else is thinking and scared to say ” shares T.I. “He talks about life's most difficult and embarrassing moments. To take these things and find ways to make people laugh especially when folks see fit to cry is comedy at its finest." Duval can currently be seen on two MTV series Guy Code and Hip Hop Squares but he’s not done yet. “Everything that you can do and even more that hasn’t been done yet” is a serious goal for him. “Whatever it is the people want me to do I’m going to do it. And I’m going to be the best at it ” he promises refusing to rest until he reaches the pinnacle of “comedy at its finest.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.ticketweb.com/i/00/08/01/37/11/Original.jpg?v=3" alt="Lil Duval"/&gt;</description>

      <title>Arnez J</title>

      <description>Dec 18-21 - To those in the know Arnez J. is quickly emerging as one of the hottest, most talked about comedic artists in the game. His raw energy, talent and comedic skill quickly landed Arnez the coveted hosting slot on BET’s longest-running comedy series “Comic View” for two seasons joining the ranks of hosts such as D.L. Hughley and Cedric the Entertainer. His hilarious new comedy special “Racially Motivated” is now available on Netflix. Arnez J.'s charisma and physical agility are unforgettable. “J is a whirling dervish on stage--he runs, jumps, spins, slides, slips, and mugs through a performance, acting out many of his bits while describing them,” wrote Doug Kaufman in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Arnez admits of himself “I've always expressed my things through mannerisms and facial expressions rather than speaking.” On his own at age 14, Arnez lied about his age to get a job at a gas station to work his way through school. With dreams to become a professional baseball player, Arnez began working as a flight attendant when those baseball plans fell through. It was while working as a flight attendant that Arnez discovered his comedic talent. He realized that he had the ability to keep the passengers and crew laughing and, upon encouragement from friends, he made his first attempt at stand-up comedy. After that first night on stage, he knew what he wanted to do. He left his job with the airlines and made the decision to devote all of his time to a career in comedy. Arnez got a chance to combine his ambitions as both an athlete and performer when he was recruited by scouts for the famed Harlem Globetrotters basketball team who saw his very physical comedy routine at a local basketball game. However, after several months, a knee injury ended his Globetrotters career, finally clearing the way for him to devote himself full time to standup comedy. An Atlanta native, Arnez began working the comedy circuit in Georgia and quickly became one of “Hotlanta's” funniest newcomers. A finalist in the “Bay Area Black Comedy Competition,” he was immediately noticed by the entertainment industry and was asked to make his first television appearance on Showtime's “Comedy Club Network.” Numerous television appearances soon followed including appearances on “The Keenan Ivory Wayans Show,” “Louie Anderson's Comedy Showcase,” Comedy Central's “Make Me Laugh,” NBC's “Friday Night Videos,” “The Mo’Nique Show”, Russell Simmons' “Def Comedy Jam,” his own BET “Comic View Grandstand Hour Special,” and “Comedy Central Presents: Arnez J.” He was most recently seen headlining Showtime’s “Shaquille O'Neal Presents: All Star Comedy Jam.” Today, Arnez is widely considered one of the best working artists, with a polished and highly entertaining standup routine that keeps his audiences entertained without having to use profanity. In keeping with his plan, Arnez keeps up a dizzying pace performing for sold out crowds at arenas and other venues across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.ticketweb.com/i/00/08/02/01/51/Original.jpg?v=3?v=3" alt="Arnez J"/&gt;</description>

      <title>Carlos Mencia</title>

      <description>Mar 13-15 - Comedian Carlos Mencia is best known for his raw and unfiltered style of comedy, which he has showcased to great success on comedy stages, and in television shows and movies. He has recently gone back to his comedic roots on his No Hate No Fear comedy tour, sharing his newest material with smaller, more intimate audiences. As a comedian who finds the hilarious irony in both the day-to-day and the newsworthy events, Carlos is never lacking in material; he recently shot two stand-up specials due out later this year. Carlos will also reprise his role as Felix Boulevardez in Disney+'s "The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder," the revival of the groundbreaking animated series "The Proud Family." The show is heading into its second season. Mencia comes from a humble background, born in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the 17th of 18 children. His parents sent him to the United States when he was three months old, where he was raised in the Maravilla Projects in Los Angeles by his aunt and uncle. In his early teens, Mencia moved back to Honduras. When Mencia returned to Los Angeles, he showed such educational prowess that he pursued a career in engineering. But an amateur night at the world-renowned Laugh Factory comedy club would change his path, and a career in comedy began. He became a regular at The Comedy Store, performing nightly. After he found success on the Los Angeles comedy circuit, Mencia was named International Comedy Grand Champion from Buscando Estrellas (the Latin version of Star Search), eventually landing on shows such as "In Living Color," "The Arsenio Hall Show," and "An Evening at the Improv." Mencia continued his journey up the comedy ladder by headlining stand-up tours and starring in stand-up TV specials. In 2002, he received a CableACE Award nomination for Best Stand-Up Comedy Special for his HBO special. Comedy Central soon took notice and the show "Mind of Mencia" went into development. Created by Carlos and comedy producer Robert Morton, the comedy series featured Carlos and his crew with their merciless mix of up-close stand-up, unconventional street interviews, and shocking commercial parodies. The show was an instant hit, and propelled Mencia to the comedy elite. After the first season, Comedy Central signed Mencia back for an original stand-up special, "Carlos Mencia: No Strings Attached," the first Comedy Central Stand-up Special DVD to achieve Platinum sales status. Throughout the four seasons of “Mind of Mencia,” Carlos never stopped performing live, headlining shows across the country and internationally. “Comedy is my art, and fans are my passion,” he has said. Always looking to give back to those fans, Mencia has entertained troops serving overseas for USO tours in Turkey, Kirkuk, Baghdad, Qatar, Afghanistan, and many other countries. Later, Mencia went on to star on the big screen. He starred opposite Ben Stiller and Michelle Monaghan in "The Heartbreak Kid," and in the family-comedy "Our Family Wedding," alongside America Ferrara and Forrest Whitaker. Carlos Mencia presently lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two sons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.ticketweb.com/i/00/07/87/32/81/Original.jpg?v=3" alt="Carlos Mencia"/&gt;</description>
